I'm a Brazilian-Canadian senior software engineer who loves the idea of destroying all the gatekeeping that exists around software. I'm particularly passionate about making very complex systems sound so simple that a person can only think: "is that all?"

I majored in computer science at University of Campinas and worked on the debugger for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) at Microsoft for 6 years. I'm based in Vancouver.

I'm currently working on **[NEVERWAY](https://neverwaygame.com)** and a [game engine](https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder) as co-founder at Coldblood Inc. It's been really fun!!!!
