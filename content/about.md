I am a Brazilian software engineer who loves the idea of destroying all the gatekeeping that exists around software. I am particularly passionate about making very complex systems sound so simple that a person can only think: "is that all?"

I am graduated in computer science at [University of Campinas](https://ic.unicamp.br/en/) and currently work in the debugger for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) at Microsoft.

## I got a few patents over the years
* [Data breakpoints on certain kinds of functions](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11392482)

I am also a game developer on my free time and I have been working on an ECS game engine (and a game) with [Saint11](http://saint11.org/).
