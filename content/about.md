I'm a Brazilian senior software engineer who loves the idea of destroying all the gatekeeping that exists around software. I'm particularly passionate about making very complex systems sound so simple that a person can only think: "is that all?"

I majored in computer science at [University of Campinas](https://ic.unicamp.br/en/) and worked in the debugger for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) at Microsoft for 6 years. I currently live in Vancouver.

## I got a few patents over the years
* [Data breakpoints on certain kinds of functions](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11392482)
* [Hot reloading a running application with an unsaved source code change](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11573787)
* [Source code editing combining edit and continue with hot reload](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230080221)

I'm also a game developer in my full time now! I've been working on an ECS game engine (and a game) with [Saint11](http://saint11.org/).
