My first time as a GDC speaker on ways you can build sustainable tools!

<!--more-->

I got to do a 1-hour talk on GDC on how I manage to balance gameplay and tools development in a way that scales on the long term. Unfortunately, there's no free way to watch this talk (yet????) but here's a link anyway:

- [GDC Vault: Making Delightful Tools for Sustainable Small-Team Development ](https://gdcvault.com/play/1035261/Making-Delightful-Tools-for-Sustainable)

And here's the [full deck for the talk](https://isadorasophia.com/talks/engine-talk.pdf).

The talk can roughly be summarized in the following nine tips:

1. Game always comes first
2. Stick to your goals
3. Never crash (lol)
4. Make it delightful (or fun)
5. Only do it once it's a bottleneck
6. Scale horizontally
7. You don't have to do everything yourself
8. Prototype, implement, refactor
9. Trust yourself!

The content was largely inspired by my previous [two](http://localhost:1313/post/tips-future-proof-engine/) [other](http://localhost:1313/post/oop-overrated/) talks. 

I had the help of an awesome mentor, Chris Butcher, to put this content together, so I'd say this format is much more polished and in-depth than the previous ones. I ended up learning a lot in the process and I'm super grateful for this experience!
