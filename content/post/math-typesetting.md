A talk explaining how debuggers work and what to expect when debugging your application.

<!--more-->

This was my first talk and I was super proud of it. Unfortunately, it was a part of a recruiting talk in Microsoft at Brazilian universities, so I did not get a recording of it.

However, you can find the demos and the deck available [here](https://github.com/isadorasophia/debugger-demo/blob/master/deck.pdf).
