A short talk on ways to build modular code, regardless of the language.

[Full Indie Summit](https://www.fullindie.com/) is a super cool Vancouver nonprofit organization for the local game dev community. Besides their monthly meetups, they organize the **Full Indie Summit** every year, which is basically a track of eight talks on the same day (and same room!), each with up to 20 minutes. My favorite part is how each talk is different from each other - you can learn about audio, law, community management, all in the same day.

I'm obviously biased towards C# (if you haven't noticed already), but I cover approaches that can be practical regardless of the language you choose to code:

- Entity Component System (ECS!)
- Code generation
- Game assets
- Reflection

I also emphasize how important it is to still rely on OOP if that makes sense. I strongly believe that game development is all about flexibility, not about proving that you can do the "cleanest" architecture - although good practices always help scaling and actually finishing your projects!
