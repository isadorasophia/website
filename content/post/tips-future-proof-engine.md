[BUS Game Devs](https://busgda.ca/) is a nonprofit organization that organizes events to the Vancouver game development community. Their events are really my favorite and I attend pretty much all of them! I highly recommend checking their other videos or even attend one of their events, if you have the chance. I was super happy that I got a chance to do my own talk there!
