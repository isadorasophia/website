Gum is a narrative scripting language that integrates with Murder Engine.

Now, you might be asking, why would I do my own scripting language? I don't know! But it's been very fun and I keep working on it every time I want to do something odd while writing for [Neverway](/projects/neverway), so it's been great. 

You can check the source and instructions on how to use Gum [here](https://github.com/isadorasophia/gum). I even added support for a syntax highlighter in VS Code and Sublime!
