Neverway is a nightmarish life sim RPG and [Coldblood Inc.](https://coldbloodinc.studio/)'s debut game. 

<!--more-->

The game is funded by [Outersloth](https://www.innersloth.com/outersloth/) and I'm a co-director on the game with a dream team. I'm incredibly excited that I can finally talk about it more!

We have the ‚ú®[coolest website](https://neverwaygame.com)‚ú® that was largely inspired by my 2000s neopets era.

I can't describe how much fun it has been to come up with a bunch of weird ideas and just put them in the game. Actually, this is probably the reason why I became a programmer in the first place: I just like having weird ideas and just being able to DO them!!!! The fact that Pedro is an insanely fast artist also helps immensely...
